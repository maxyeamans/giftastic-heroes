# Giftastic Heroes

## What it is
This is a small app to test connecting with Giphy API using jQuery's `ajax()` method.

## How to use it
Click one of the buttons at the top to query Giphy for 10 gifs related to that Marvel hero. The gifs are static at first; you need to click one to start animating it, and click it again to make it static. If you don't see a button for the hero you want, you can type a new hero into the text box and add it to the list.

## What I used
* Bootstrap for design
* jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests
* Giphy API to retrieve gifs and static pics
